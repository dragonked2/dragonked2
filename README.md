## 🚀 About Me

I’m **Ali Essam**, a passionate **Penetration Tester**, **Bug Bounty Hunter**, and **Cybersecurity Expert** with over **8 years** of hands-on experience identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities in web applications, APIs, and cloud platforms.

As the **Founder & CEO** of [DragonMeta](https://www.dmeta.one/), I specialize in providing expert **pen testing** and **vulnerability assessments** for global clients, including **Google**, **NASA**, and other leading tech firms.

I’m constantly challenging myself to stay ahead of emerging threats, improving my skillset through **bug bounty programs**, and contributing to the security community.

## 🔍 What I Do

### 💻 **Penetration Testing**

- **Web Application Security:** Conducting deep dives into web applications and APIs to identify critical vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.).
- **Exploitation & Remediation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities, assessing their impact, and providing actionable remediation steps.
- **Cloud Security:** Assessing cloud-based environments (AWS, Azure) for misconfigurations, weak security settings, and vulnerabilities.

### 🎯 **Bug Bounty Hunting**

- **HackerOne & Bugcrowd:** Actively hunting bugs on top platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd, with over **450 vulnerabilities** reported, including **zero-day exploits**.
- **Hall of Fame Recognition:** Recognized for significant contributions in securing high-risk web applications, APIs, and cloud infrastructures for global enterprises.
- **Vulnerability Research:** Continuously exploring novel attack vectors, automating workflows, and sharing findings with the cybersecurity community.

### 🛠 **Security Tools & Techniques**

- **Pen Testing Tools:** Proficient in using **Burp Suite**, **Metasploit**, **Wireshark**, **Nmap**, and custom scripts for comprehensive security testing.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):** Testing and bypassing WAFs to identify security gaps.
- **Automation:** Writing custom tools and scripts (in **Python**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**) to automate repetitive tasks and vulnerability scanning.

## 🌟 **Highlighted Projects & Achievements**

- **Egyscan**: Created and open-sourced [Egyscan](https://github.com/dragonked2/Egyscan), a **web vulnerability scanner** that detects common web app security issues.
- **Bug Bounty Contributions**: Identified and reported critical vulnerabilities, including **zero-days**, on platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd, earning **Hall of Fame** recognitions.
